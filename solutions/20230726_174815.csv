    return max_gap","To find the longest binary gap in a positive integer N, we can convert N to its binary representation and then iterate over the binary digits. We can keep track of the current binary gap length and update the maximum binary gap length whenever we encounter a '1' digit. At the end, we return the maximum binary gap length."
